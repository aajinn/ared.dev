## AI-Powered Plant Leaf Disease Detection

A full-stack AI system that analyzes plant leaf images to detect diseases, assess severity, and provide actionable treatment guidance. Built with a modern backend API and an interactive frontend UI for seamless user experience.

### Features

- **AI Disease Classification**: Detects 500+ types of leaf diseases (fungal, bacterial, viral, pests, nutrient deficiency) using advanced models. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Severity Assessment**: Outputs severity levels (mild/moderate/severe) with confidence scores to help prioritize interventions. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Interactive Web UI**: Image upload and instant results via Streamlit interface for intuive user engagement. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **REST API Backend**: Robust FastAPI service powering predictions and integration with other tools. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Treatment Insights**: Provides recommended actions based on detected symptoms. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Optimized Performance**: Sub-5 second inference times for real-world responsiveness. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI for RESTful prediction API  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for rapid interactive UI  
- **AI Engine**: Meta Llama Vision models via Groq API  
- **Deployment**: Ready for cloud (e.g., Vercel) or local setup  
- **Testing**: Automated test suite for API and model logic
- **Payment Gateway**: Razorpay for seamless INR transactions and UPI support


### Development Process
